#What I Learned

I appreciated the straight walk-through of how to set everything up from the very beginning. It confirmed a lot of things I already did but wondered if I'd done right, and taught me easier ways to do some functions I'd done before but wasn't sure I'd done right. For instance, I've used AJAX calls before, but your simple walk-through and explanation cleared things up for me.

JSLint was frustrating at first - who cares about indentation that much?! But in the end it does help keep things a lot cleaner, and I felt like I understood my code more after having to fix it enough to satisfy jslint.

'use strict' was a new concept as well - you mentioned it in class, but I understand it better now. I also understand using const and let much better now, and the general structure of where to put all the parens and semi-colons and everything now. I've worked with JS a lot before, but it always helps to practice to know when to close your statements or not.

I could still use a bit more help understanding what window.location does, but I'll look that up. You might have even gone over that specifically in your video, my bad if that's the case.
